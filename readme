Readme:

This is a repository that I created for my capstone project for the Google 
Data Analytics Professional certificate, offered via Coursera.  

For my capstone project I elected to analyze bikeshare data from a fictional 
company offering bike rentals in Chicago, IL.  

All of the steps of data analysis were done in R and are documented in RMarkdown
files, which were then knit to html.  

The .html files should be able to be opened in any browser after downloading.

Unfortunately the .Rmd files cannot be knit to .html without external data, as most 
of the data files were too large to upload to Github.  If someone starts 
from file download, the entire workflow should be followable.  Some data and 
images representing intermediate steps of the analysis process are also included 
here.
